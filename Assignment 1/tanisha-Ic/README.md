# IC DevOps Batch 2 Repository

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to the IC DevOps Batch 2 course assignments, focusing on practical Git command usage and documentation. Students fork the IC repository, create a new branch (branch-1), and under Assignment 1, document Git commands with descriptions and examples in assignment_01.md. Each command includes accompanying screenshots to illustrate execution. Pull requests against the master branch demonstrate proficiency in Git operations, accompanied by explanations of interesting Git concepts.
